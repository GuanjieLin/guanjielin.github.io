<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>





I am Guanjie Lin, currently a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass Boston), under the mentorship of Prof. Yinxin Wan. I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science from Foshan University(China) in June 2024. Previously, I served as a Research Intern at the Shenzhen Key Lab for ICN and Blockchain Technologies (ICNLAB), Shenzhen Graduate School, Peking University, mentored by Prof. Kai Lei from December 2021 through most of my undergraduate studies.

My primary research interests include Future Internet architectures, Blockchain, and Security & Network related to Large Language Models (LLMs).
