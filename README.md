- # AcadHomepage (Fork)

  This is my personal academic homepage:
   ðŸ‘‰ **[guanjielin.github.io](https://guanjielin.github.io/)**

  This project is forked from [RayeRen/acad-homepage.github.io](https://github.com/RayeRen/acad-homepage.github.io), which provides a modern, responsive, and easy-to-use academic homepage template.

  ## Quick Start

  1. Fork this repo, rename it to `yourusername.github.io`, and edit `_config.yml` to set your info.
  2. Add your content to `_pages/about.md`.
  3. Push to GitHub, and your page will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io`.

  ## Acknowledgement
